## A quick refresh

+ We talked about various data structures in R
+ The primacy of the `data.frame`
  - Extracting individual variables from a data frame
    - `breast_cancer$ER.Status`, `breast_cancer[,'ER.Status']`, `breast_cancer[['ER.Status']]`
  - Extracting rows of a `data.frame`
+ Identifying data classes using the `class` function
+ Recognizing different classes: `numeric`, `character`, `factor`, `Date`, ..
  - testing for a class: `is.numeric`
  - converting to a class: `as.numeric`

# A note on factors

---

## Factors

+ Factors are stored internally as integers, with *meta-data* in the form of text labels
  - There is an inherent ordering of labels, by default alphabetically
+ Individual levels of a factor are treated as *separate* but related variables (dummy variables)

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-1, message=F}
breast_cancer <- read_csv('data/clinical_data_breast_cancer_modified.csv')
names(breast_cancer) <- make.names(names(breast_cancer))
breast_cancer$ER.Status.f <- factor(breast_cancer$ER.Status)
summary(breast_cancer$ER.Status)
summary(breast_cancer$ER.Status.f)
```

---

## Factors

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-2}
breast_cancer$ER.Status.f <- fct_relevel(breast_cancer$ER.Status.f, 'Negative')
summary(breast_cancer$ER.Status.f)
```

This is manipulating the meta-data, not the actual data itself

---

## Factors

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-3}
breast_cancer$ER.Status.n <- as.numeric(breast_cancer$ER.Status.f)
summary(breast_cancer$ER.Status.n)
```

Logistic regression of death status on ER status

.pull-left[
```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-4, echo=F}
broom::tidy(glm(as.factor(Vital.Status)~ER.Status.n, data=breast_cancer, family=binomial))[,1:2]
```

Only one coefficient, since levels are modeled as numeric, with one slope being estimated
]
.pull-right[
```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-5, echo=F}
broom::tidy(glm(as.factor(Vital.Status)~ER.Status.f, data=breast_cancer, family=binomial))[,1:2]

```

One coefficient for all but one factor level
]

---

## RMarkdown tip of the day

You can add options to each R chunk to add or suppress output

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-6, echo = F}
a <- tribble(
  ~Option, ~Property,
  "echo=T/F", "Does the document show the R code",
  "eval=T/F", "Does the chunk get evaluated by R",
  "message=T/F", "Do messages get printed",
  "warning=T/F", "Do warnings get printed"
)
knitr::kable(a, format='html')
```

You can also set these once per session by putting the following in a R chunk:

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-7, eval=F}
knitr::opts_chunk(echo=T, eval=T, message=F, warning=F)
```

See [here](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#chunk-options) for the full gory details

# Data ingestion

---

## Data ingestion

Unlike Excel, you have to pull data into R for R to operate on it

Typically your data is in some sort of file (Excel, csv, sas7bdat, dta, txt)

You need to find a way to pull it into R

The GUI you've used is one way, but not very programmatic

---

## Data ingestion

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-8, echo=F}
b <- tribble(
  ~Type, ~Function, ~Package,~Notes,
  "csv", "read_csv", "readr", "Takes care of formatting",
  "csv", "read.csv", "base", "Built in",
  "csv", "fread", "data.table", "Fastest",
  "Excel", "read_excel", "readxl",'',
  'sas7bdat','read_sas', 'haven','SAS format',
  'sav', 'read_spss', 'haven','SPSS format',
  'dta','read_dta', 'haven', 'Stata format'
)
knitr::kable(b, format='html')
```

---

# Data ingestion

We will use [this](data/BreastCancer_Clinical.csv) csv data and [this](data/BreastCancer.xlsx) Excel data for the following:

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-9, message=F}
brca_clinical <- readr::read_csv('data/BreastCancer_Clinical.csv')
brca_clinical2 <- data.table::fread('data/BreastCancer_Clinical.csv')
```

.pull-left[
```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-10}
str(brca_clinical)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-11}
str(brca_clinical2)
```
]

---

## A note on two "super"-data.frame objects

.pull-left[
A `tibble`
```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-12, echo=F}
head(brca_clinical)
```
]
.pull-right[
A `data.table`

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-13, echo=F}
head(brca_clinical2)
```
]

---

## A note on two "super"-data.frame objects

+ A `tibble` works pretty much like any `data.frame`, but the printing is a little saner
+ A `data.table` is faster, has more inherent functionality, but has a ver different syntax

We'll work almost entirely with `tibble`'s and not `data.table`

--

Suggested modifications:

+ If using `fread`, convert the resulting object to a `data.frame` or `tibble` using `as_data_frame()` or `as_tibble`
+ Convert the column names to not have spaces using, for example,

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-14}
names(brca_clinical) <- make.names(names(brca_clinical))
```

---

## Data ingestion

Note that you **have** to give a name to what you're importing using `read_*` or whatever you're using, otherwise it won't stay in R

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-15, eval=F}
brca_clinical <- readr::read_csv('data/BreastCancer_Clinical.csv')
```

![](img/env.png)

---

## Reading Excel

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-16}
readxl::excel_sheets('data/BreastCancer.xlsx')
brca_expression <- readxl::read_excel('data/BreastCancer.xlsx', sheet='Expression')
```

# Data export

## Data export

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-17, echo=F}
b <- tribble(
  ~Type, ~Function, ~Package,~Notes,
  "csv", "write_csv", "readr", "Takes care of formatting",
  "csv", "write.csv", "base", "Built in",
  "csv", "fwrite", "data.table", "Fastest",
  "Excel", "write.xlsx", "openxlsx",'',
  'sas7bdat','write_sas', 'haven','SAS format',
  'sav', 'write_spss', 'haven','SPSS format',
  'dta','write_dta', 'haven', 'Stata format'
)
knitr::kable(b, format='html')
```

We'll often save tabular results using these functions

---

## Simplifying import/export

We'll be using a package that makes this easier. 

It's called `rio` and it has two basic functions: `import` and `export`.

The `rio` package uses the different packages mentioned earlier but unifies it into a single syntax

### Classwork

Open an Rmd file, and create a R chunk where you use the function `import` from `rio` to 
load the clinical breast cancer data into R

- Note, you have to "activate" the `rio` package in the chunk
- You have to save the imported object by giving it a name

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-18, echo=F}
countdown(minutes=10L)
```

# The tidyverse

---

## What is the tidyverse?

> The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. -- Dr. Hadley Wickham

- A human-friendly syntax and semantics to make code more understandable
- The functions in the tidyverse often wraps harder-to-understand functions into simpler, more understandable forms
- We're taking an opinionated choice here
    - Covers maybe 85% of the cases you'll ever face
    - Takes a particular viewpoint about how data _should_ be organized
- But this makes things easier and simpler

---

## What's tidy here?

The way data is organized in a data frame is __tidy__ in this framework.

1. Each variable must have its own column.
1. Each observation must have its own row.
1. Each value must have its own cell.

--

In practical terms:

1. Put data in a data frame / _tibble_
1. Make sure each variable is in its own column

---

## Tidy data

A first step in the tidyverse is to activate the `tidyverse` meta-package

```{r 01-lecture1-31, message = F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

<font size=5>
.pull-left[
```{r 01-lecture1-32, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
tidy_pkgs <- 
  tibble('pkgs' = c('ggplot2','purrr','readr','tidyr',
                    'dplyr','forcats','lubridate','stringr')) %>% 
  mutate(
    descr = map_chr(pkgs, ~packageDescription(., fields='Title')))

glue_data(tidy_pkgs[1:4,], 
          "- [**{pkgs}**](http://{pkgs}.tidyverse.org): {descr}")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r 01-lecture1-33, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
glue_data(tidy_pkgs[5:8,], 
          "- [**{pkgs}**](http://{pkgs}.tidyverse.org): {descr}")
```
]
</font>

---

## Tidy data

The common feature of all these packages is that their functions take a 
data frame (which the tidyverse calls a `tibble`) as their first argument.

So the starting point for any analysis is the data set.

---

## Tidy data

```{r 01-lecture1-34}
table1
```

Is this tidy?

---

## Tidy data

```{r 01-lecture1-35}
table2
```

Is this tidy?

---

## Tidy data

```{r 01-lecture1-36}
table3
```

Is this tidy?

---


## Tidy data

```{r 01-lecture1-37}
table4a # cases
table4b # population
```

Are these tidy?

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

Sometimes. The functions in the `tidyr` package can help

- `separate` is a function that can split a column into multiple columns
    - When there are multiple variables together in a column
    
```{r 01-lecture1-38}
table3
```

We need to separate `rate` into two variables, cases and population

---



## Can we make datasets tidy?

```{r 01-lecture1-39}
separate(table3, col = rate, into = c("cases", "population"), 
         sep = "/")
```

> I've been explicit about naming all the options. R functions can work by 
position as well, so `separate(table3, rate, c('cases','population'), '/')` would work, but it's not very clear, is it?

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

```{r 01-lecture1-40}
table2
```

Here there are observations on two variables in successive rows

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

We need to `spread` these rows out into different columns

.pull-left[
```{r 01-lecture1-41}
spread(table2, key = type, value = count)
```
]
.pull-right[
![](img/spread.png)
]

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

```{r 01-lecture1-42}
table4a
```

Here, the variable for year is stored as a header, not as data in a cell.

We need to `gather` that data and put it into a column

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

.pull-left[
```{r 01-lecture1-43}
tidyr::gather(table4a, key = year, value = cases, `1999`, `2000`)
```
]
.pull-right[
![](img/gather.png)
]

---

## Making data tidy

Admittedly, `spread` and `gather` are not easy concepts, but we'll practice with them more. 

1. `gather` collects multiple columns into 2, and only 2 columns
    - One column represents the data in the column headers
    - One column represents the values in the column
    - All other columns are repeated to keep all the data properly associated
1. `spread` takes two columns and makes them multiple columns
    - The values in one column form the headers to different new columns
    - The values in the other column represent the values in the corresponding cells
    - The other columns are repeated to start with, but reduce repetitions to make all associated data stay together
    
---

## Progress check

Load the data from [this link](data/pew.csv). You can look the structure by `head(____)` where `___` is what you named the dataset. 

What do you think you would need to do to make this data tidy? (Hint: look at the column headers)

```{r 03-DataIngestionMunging-19, echo=F}
countdown(minutes=5)
```

--

What function would you want to use?

--

Fill in the blanks:

```{r 01-lecture1-44, eval=F, echo = T}
gather(______, key = _____, value = ________, ______,______,_______,
             _______,________,_________,__________,__________,____)
```

--

This is a lot of writing. There's gotta be something simpler

---

## A friendly way of selecting columns

The tidyverse gives us a nice way of selecting, or not selecting columns

Instead of all the writing, we could simply say

```{r aa2, eval=F}
pew <- read_csv('data/pew.csv')
tidyr::gather(pew, key = income, value = count, -religion)
```

--

```{r 01-lecture1-45, ref.label='aa2', echo=F, eval=T, message=F}
```

---

## `dplyr` verbs in the tidyverse

The `dplyr` package gives us a few verbs for data manipulation

```{r 01-lecture1-46, echo = F, results='asis'}
dat <- tribble(
  ~Function, ~Purpose,
  'select', "Select columns based on name or position",
  'mutate', 'Create or change a column',
  'filter', 'Extract rows based on some criteria',
  'arrange', 'Re-order rows based on values of variable(s)',
  'group_by', 'Split a dataset by unique values of a variable',
  'summarize', 'Create summary statistics based on columns')
knitr::kable(dat, format='markdown')
```

---

## `select`

You can select columns by name or position, of course. 

You can also select columns based on some criteria, which are encapsulated in functions.

- starts_with("___"), ends_with("___"), contains("____")
- one_of("____","_____","______")

There are others; see `help(starts_with)`.

---

## Example

Load [this file](data/weather.csv). This contains daily temperature data in 2010 for some location.

```{r 01-lecture1-47, echo = T}
weather <- rio::import('data/weather.csv')
# weather <- readr::read_csv(here::here('slides','lectures','data','FSI','weather.csv'))
```
```{r 01-lecture1-48}
head(weather, 2)
```

How would you just select the columns with the daily data?

--

```{r 01-lecture1-49, eval = F}
select(weather, starts_with("d"))
```

---

## mutate

`mutate` can either transform a column in place or create a new column in a dataset

We'll use the in-built `mpg` dataset for this example, We'll select only the city and highway mileages. To use this selection later, we will need to assign it to a new name

```{r 01-lecture1-50}
mpg1 <- select(mpg, cty, hwy)
```

---

## mutate

We'll change the city and highway mileage to km/l from mpg. This will involve multiplying it by 1.6 and dividing by 3.8

.pull-left[
```{r 01-lecture1-51}
mutate(mpg1, cty = cty * 1.6 / 3.8, hwy = hwy * 1.6/3.8)
```
This is in-place replacement
]
.pull-right[
```{r 01-lecture1-52}
mutate(mpg1, cty1 = cty * 1.6/3.8, hwy1 = hwy * 1.6/3.8)
```
This creates new variables
]

---

## filter

`filter` extracts rows based on criteria

```{r 01-lecture1-53}
filter(mpg, cyl == 4)
```

This extracts only 4 cylinder vehicles

--

Other choices might be `cyl != 4`, `cyl > 4`, `year == 1999`, `manufacturer=="audi"`

---

## Exercise

We already saw the weather data. It's not tidy. Let's work to make it tidy.

# Welcome {-}


## Reproducibility {-}

These notes are written with [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org), a R package for writing books using [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
All code in these notes were developed on `r R.version$version.string`, using
the same packages pre-installed in your virtual machines. When you're on your
own, you will need to install a recent version of R, and also install the
corresponding packages, on your computer, for all the code to work. A listing of
all the packages used in this course will be available as an appendix.
